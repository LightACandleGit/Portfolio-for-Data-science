Here I will collect projects I've done in the past, mostly using statistical methods (machine learning and AI) but also more general data analysis. The complete R portfolio published on RPubs can be found here: [Link](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/).


### Portfolio for ML Projects

* [Data Exploratory Analysis using the BRFSS-2013 Dataset](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/BRFSS2013)

     Data Exploratory project using R to try and answer some questions regarding health.
     
* [MoneyBall: Data Analysis Project](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/MoneyBallproject)

     A data analysis project inspired by the book MoneyBall by Michael Lewis. We try to find possible replacement players based on statistics and salary requirements.

* [Smaller ML Project using Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/logisticregression)

     Logistic Regression project using R for prediction of income.

* [Smaller ML Project using Decision Trees and Random Forest](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/logisticregression)

     Decision tree project to try and predict whether a school is a private or public college.

* [Visualizaion Project](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/economistlike)

     A smaller visualization project where we visualize the HDI vs CPI in a 'Economist' style.

### Computational Finance Projects

A PhD course in Computational Finance. Pricing of options using FEM with MatLab. A [link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~krikir/ComputationalFinance.html) to the course website.

  * [Project 1: FEM for European and digital options in Blackâ€“Scholes
markets](https://www.docdroid.net/gG6pJ2W/project1-mmf120.pdf)

      Project in Computational Finance, using matlab. Main task of the project is to price European and Digital options in Black-Scholes markets using FEM and study the convergence of the error rate while creating a finer mesh. A [link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~krikir/projects/project1.pdf) to the project description 

  * [Project 2: European and American contracts under the CEV model](https://www.docdroid.net/l32FpvD/mmf120project2.pdf)
  
      Second project in Computational Finance. Main task here was to price European and American contracts under the CEV model using FEM. A [link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~krikir/projects/project2.pdf) to the project description. 

### Thesis

Here I show my Master's and Bachelor's thesis at the Mathematical Statistics program at the University of Gothenburg. 

My Master's thesis: 

  * [Master's Thesis](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~palbin/Christian_Kallgren.pdf)
    
      [Abstract]: We look at numerical methods for simulation of stochastic differential equations
exhibiting volatility induced stationarity. This is a property of the process which
means that the stationary behaviour is mostly imposed by how volatile the process
is. The property creates issues in simulation and hence also in statistical methods.
The methods considered for simulations are the fully implicit Euler scheme and timechanged
simulation. We look at statistical methods for estimation of parameters.
The specific statistical methods we investigate is the likelihood ratio, which gives
expressions for the drift parameters for CKLS and least squares estimation, which is
used together with quadratic variation to estimate parameters in different models.

My Bachelor's thesis written in Swedish:

  * [Bachelor's Thesis (Swedish)](https://www.docdroid.net/Rhl5nPw/rapport-mvex01-17-15.pdf)

      We tried to investigate properties of methods similar to least squares, we also looked at theory regarding spatial statistics.
