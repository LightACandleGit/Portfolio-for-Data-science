Here I will collect projects I've done in the past, mostly using statistical methods (machine learning and AI) but also more general data analysis.


### Portfolio for ML Projects

* [Data Exploratory Analysis using the BRFSS-2013 Dataset](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/BRFSS2013)

     Data Exploratory project using R to try and answer some questions regarding health.
     
* [MoneyBall: Data Analysis Project](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/MoneyBallproject)

     A data analysis project inspired by the book MoneyBall by Michael Lewis. We try to find possible replacement players based on statistics and salary requirements.

* [Smaller ML Project using Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/logisticregression)

     Logistic Regression project using R for prediction of income.

* [Smaller ML Project using Decision Trees and Random Forest](http://rpubs.com/LightACandle/logisticregression)

     Decision tree project to try and predict whether a school is a private or public college.

### Computational Finance Projects

A PhD course in Computational Finance. Pricing of options using FEM with MatLab. A [link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~krikir/ComputationalFinance.html) to the course website.

  * [Project 1: FEM for European and digital options in Blackâ€“Scholes
markets](https://www.docdroid.net/gG6pJ2W/project1-mmf120.pdf)

      Project in Computational Finance, using matlab. Main task of the project is to price European and Digital options in Black-Scholes markets using FEM and study the convergence of the error rate while creating a finer mesh. A [link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~krikir/projects/project1.pdf) to the project description 

  * [Project 2: European and American contracts under the CEV model](https://www.docdroid.net/l32FpvD/mmf120project2.pdf)
  
      Second project in Computational Finance. Main task here was to price European and American contracts under the CEV model using FEM. A link to the project description. 

### Thesis

My Master's thesis: 

  * [Master's Thesis](http://www.math.chalmers.se/~palbin/Christian_Kallgren.pdf)
  
      I look at the performance of maximum likelihood methods for estimation of parameters for specific stochastic differential equations. But also some numerical simulation methods, and their performances. 

My Bachelor's thesis written in Swedish:

  * [Bachelor's Thesis (Swedish)](https://www.docdroid.net/Rhl5nPw/rapport-mvex01-17-15.pdf)

      We tried to investigate properties of methods similar to least squares, we also looked at theory regarding spatial statistics.
